🧠 Overview
This repository hosts the first public-facing visual and framework summary for the miRNA Biointelligence Vol. I white paper. This system integrates over 2,900 miRNA targets, mapped across:

✅ Cancer Hallmarks

✅ ECS–GPCR signaling circuits

✅ Histone & enzyme interactions

✅ Programmed Cell Death (PCD) overlays

✅ Natural compound synergies including algae, herbs, spices, terpenes

✅ Metabolic reprogramming pathways

✅ AI-driven therapeutic stack logic

The full matrix exceeds 30,000 functional data points, forming the submolecular regulatory layer of a deployable, API-compatible therapeutic operating system (TheraOS).
